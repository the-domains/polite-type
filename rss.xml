            <description><![CDATA[<p>that design can save money.that design can alter, interfere with, or present honesty.that design requires thought, curiosity, research, engagement, exploration, and editing.that it is always the designer’s fault.that designers should not have a recognizable style outside of a style of thinking, and integrity towards concept and client.that there are three forms of honesty in all design work: honesty to the client (actual and projected image), honesty to the viewer, and honesty to yourself (and the work, as an extension of self).that there is no such thing as bad information.that there is such thing as bad design.that there is subjectivity. This is where a strong understanding of all perspectives is necessary.that good design doesn’t have to smell like it.</p>]]></description>
