I don't yet know if cheap products should be designed well. What are you trying to communicate? Shit design screams 'affordability' and is therefore appropriate. I don't have a good answer to this thought yet. I believe that every person deserves to be exposed to the most honest design possible. The lack of design is a choice too.
